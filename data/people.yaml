    Profile Header Sentence: Aspiring educator and musician committed to cultivating mindfulness and self-empowerment
    Bio: 'I am very passionate about research in organizational behavior, especially impression management--the process in which we influence others'' perceptions of us.    During the spring semester of 2014, I took on a monastic and ascetic lifestyle through an experiential class called "Living Deliberately." The following summer, I went to Thailand to teach English to monks and learn more about Buddhism and mindfulness. I believe that cultivating mindfulness and awareness is one thing we all can and should do.    On campus, I founded a hip hop rap group called "KLASS." I believe that the experience of writing lyrics, rapping, and sharing it with the community has incredible potential for self-empowerment and "other-empowerment."    As an aspiring educator and musician, I want to connect the knowledge from academia and mindfulness practices with the medium of rap and music to help others cultivate awareness and self-empowerment.'

    Bio: 'I was born and raised in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I have always been very passionate about helping people in need and find ways to economically empower the poor. For this reason, my most significant involvements at Penn include clubs that have a strong social impact aspect. I was the chair of community service in Wharton Latino and belonged to the Nicaragua team of Penn Microfinance. Yet, my most important contribution so far has been to take part in the creation of Compass Capital, Philadelphia''s first student-led MFI. I currently serve as CCO of the fund and hope to find through this experience a sustainable model that could be applied to aid poverty in Ecuador.'

    Profile Header Sentence: Global citizen looking to create opportunities for leadership and entrepreneurship in the Philippines
    Bio: ' Patricia began her career in Finance, in New York,  where she spent four years in Global Corporate Banking at Citi.  Her career path led her to Bridgewater, a hedgefund in Westport, Connecticut, where she spent another two years.     After ten years of being away, Patricia decided it was time to make her way home.  She spent several months traveling across continents en route to the Philippines to chase her dream of giving back.  She joined the Teach for the Philippinesâ€™ Leadership Team in 2012 to launch the program. Having to sport multiple hats for the start-up, she is currently Chief Strategic Resources Officer for the organization.  TFP has recruited ~100 of the countryâ€™s most promising young leaders who, for two years, will be teaching across public school classrooms in the country.     When not dreaming ways to sustainably scale TFP, Patricia spends whatâ€™s left of her time tinkering in the kitchen, in a yoga studio, or on a potterâ€™s wheel.'

    Bio: ' During my senior year at Penn, I reflected on what made work meaningful to me. I struggled to find it in the glamor of finance and consulting, and instead looked to how I could use my interest in law and economics to create value outside of the private sector. At the core of most economic issues is a lack of reliable, legal infrustructure. As I venture into the legal profession, I hope to bring increased access to legal information and minimize the information costs that burden social entrepreneurs.'

    Profile Header Sentence: Aspiring leader in creating democratic schools, a place where each student defines his or her own goals and learning objectives.
    Bio: ' My goal is to create a network of schools where each student defines his or her own goals and learning objectives. I believe in democratic education, because I have seen its potential for transformation firsthand.      In the summer of 2012, a college friend and I, taught 2D animation to over 40 underserved youth in Nuestra Escuela, a democratic school, in Puerto Rico. At Nuestra Escuela, I met students who were involved in gangs and dealt drugs. I met one teenager whose brother was killed in front of his eyes. Today, this teenager, and others like him, have been able to graduate from high school and get jobs in the formal sector. This is all thanks to the fact that at Nuestra Escuela, each student defines his or her own goals and learning objectives. The teachers are there to help them achieve their goals.     This is why I believe in democratic schools. I welcome you to join me on this journey.'

    Profile Header Sentence: Social entrepreneur committed to empowering youth with the problem solving and entrepreneurial skills to create social change in their own communities.
    Bio: 'As the Founder and Program Director of Global Youth United, a curriculum based program that empowers students to become social entrepreneurs in their communities, I''ve been inspired by the raw talent in the youth I''ve worked with. GYU alums have organized to fight budget cuts to their public school district through state-level lobbying, citywide protests, and artistic expression. Another group of students helped raise the housing capacity of Philadelphia''s only shelter for homeless veterans by 64%.     In practice, Global Youth United partners Philadelphia schools with a team of mentors who are undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania. Together, these students use the GYU Problem Solving CurriculumÂ© to identify issues in their community, then design and implement strategies to affect the issue.    The work of GYU students has been invigorating in my personal life and leaves me with high hopes for a future filled with positive social change. We''re growing quickly and are looking for investors and -most importantly- talent! '

    Profile Header Sentence: Innovative community builder building caring medical teams to provide greater access to high quality health care.
    Bio: ' My learning journey began my sophomore year in sociology where I uncovered the ugly truth I lived through plainly stated over and over again: Poverty entraps sick individuals in a cycle of illness, disease and poor health they cannot easily escape. In my studies, I took a three-pronged approach, studying health communications, community leadership and organizing, and medical sociology. By understanding health change models, community behavioral health, and medical history, I learned theory and combined with my clinical volunteering and bio-medical research, I gained insights into the true meaning of medicine, beyond the science, diagnoses and technicalities.   I saw how patients and physicians worked together to create an accessible, well-designed and caring treatment plan. Quickly, I discovered this: for a patient to get better, a cohesive health care community must be created. Now I am working to harness this knowledge, leadership and entrepreneurial skills to create a model for better health care access & delivery.'

    What's been your proudest moment SINCE participating in a CSIS program?:
    Describe the CSIS community and what it means to you in one sentence.: Melody Beattie once said, "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough and more; It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity...It can turn a meal into a FEAST! a house into a HOME! a stranger into a FRIEND!" and that is what the CSIS community did and became for me.
