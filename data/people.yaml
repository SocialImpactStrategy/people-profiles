  tagline: Storytelling-strategist passionate about the power of narrative to evoke empathy and education to transform lives
  bio: "I am a graduate of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Economics with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in English. I am currently working in Dubai as a Junior Strategist at Wolff Olins, a global brand consultancy focused on creating positive impact, both commercial and social. My past work experience include internships with Deloitte Consulting LLP, Ernst & Young and DDB Worldwide Communications Inc. I have also worked for two years as a fellow for the Wharton Social Impact Initiative where I helped to start-up a youth run social enterprise, Rebel Ventures, which aims to teach high-school students about entrepreneurship and nutritional justice through the management of a granola bar business. I am passionate about the intersection of storytelling and education, and always searching for opportunities to work with underserved youth. I also care deeply about creating safe spaces, experiences and communities that encourage curiosity, compassion and connection."
